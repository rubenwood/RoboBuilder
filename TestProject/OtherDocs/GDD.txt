Fend off enemies

Enemies:
	drop items
		Nothing
		Junk
		Batteries
		Parts
	Attack Player, Robos, Structures
	
Pick up items
	Must use RoboArm (upgradeable?)
	
Put items in RoboBay
	Batteries += Power
	Junk += RoboPartProgress
	
Player Choice:
	Build upgrades for self OR build other Robots?
	
	Upgrades for self may be faster to build (to an extent) but;
	there is only one of you and your personal upgrades do not benefit any bots you build
	Therefore; the player may be overwhelmed easily at higher levels
	
	Building parts is generally slower but several parts can fit together to build a bot
	Bots serve as loyal companions who assist you in fending off enemies
	However, your botlab and the junk you have collected are not ideal for making functional bots
	Therefore; bots are: weak, tempramental, may go haywire, shutdown or explode without warning :-(


PartSelector (Selects a part for replication, consumes nothing)
	
Smelter (Produce Parts, Consume Junk and Batteries):
	Select RoboPart to build from UnlockedParts		

	Power - Put in Batteries
	
	BuildComponents
		Requires Junk
		
		if(power > 1)
			if(Put Junk into RoboBay):
				BuildProgess + 1
				
		if(BuildProgress == MaxProgress):
			RoboPart complete!
			spawn Part (the part that was selected in the PartSelector)

RoboBay (Produce Robots, consume Parts):
	Put parts together to make a robot	
	Robots are comprised of at least 3 parts
		Head
		Connectors
		Legs
	If there are at least 1 of each of these 3 parts in the bay then build bot
	
	2 ways to build:
		Blueprint
			When all parts in the bay match the bp build bot
			The bp is a prebuilt design that cannot be modified
		Free
			Allow user to position parts however they wish
			Check to make sure its at least the 3 parts mentioned above

Bots:
	Put together several RoboParts to complete a bot
	
	
Mod system:
Parts can drop from enemies, sometimes these parts will have a modifier
These modifiers will affect the spawned robo

Enemy has chance to drop item (based off of drop table)
	if dropped item is  a part then roll on the mod table

RULES:
Allies cannot have lasers unless it gets a +NumLaser mod (and total NumLasers > 0)
if no lasers then ignore other laser mods

Replicating parts with mods has a chance of removing the mods
Perhaps certain parts hava durabilty (times it can be replicated), this could alos be affected by the mods
-----------------
Enemy Drop item ->
select from drop table ->
if part -> 
select from mod table -> 
add mod to part -> 
part in robobay -> 
add mods on parts to robo -> 
robo check mods and calculate/combine mods -> 
add totals to stats
---------------

Item Class

		if(Random.value >= item.chance)
			drop item
